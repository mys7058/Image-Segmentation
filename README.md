# Image-Segmentation

## Introduction

Image segmentation is the partitioning of a digital image into many different segments. 
Over the past 40 years, there has been rapid growth of image segmentation. Presently, algorithms fori mage segmentation are still being increased rapidly.

## Objective

Represent an image into a more relevant and simpler image to evaluate. Define our algorithm using graph partitioning.
Decompose the image graph into several disconnected components.

## Testing Results

Tested with several test cases.

### Small H that can still be decomposed.
7 vertices and 7 edges. The expected output was 0-1, 2-3-6, 4-5. Sucessfully created.
